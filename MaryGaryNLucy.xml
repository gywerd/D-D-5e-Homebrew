			<h2>Preface</h3>
			<p>To some extend any roleplayer, anachronist, reenactor, cosplater, or steam punker is a nerd. They may focus extencively on history, religion, mythology, lore, clothing, crafting, architechture, animals, sourcebooks etc. Often it enriches roleplaying. But any party has a <i>Mary the Contrary</i> or a <i>Gary</i></p>
			<p>A <b>Lucy</> (reference to Narnia - Lewis 1950) can be annoying, even when she's trying her best not to be. Maybe she doesn't really want to play, but does so to please the party. Or she has trouble comprehending the abstracts of the game.</p>
			<p><b>Gary</b> (honorary reference to <i>Gary Cygax</i>, the co-inventor of Original D&amp;D) is the player, who has read older sourcebooks extensively or has played D&amp;D for decades. They know a lot about the game - and sometimes more than the DM about particular subjects. But to the DM and other players, this can become an substantial annoyance, when they frequently refer to different campaign settings, possibilities in earlier editions and old school adventures nobody else has ever heard of.</p>
			<p><b>Mary the Contrary</b> is a player, who wants to tweak the game - often disagrees with the DM - or does exactly the opposite of, what the DM had expected and planned for the session.</p>
			<p>Typical challenges include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>beßerwißer</li>
				<li>flavour</li>
				<li>sourcebooks from older editions</li>
				<li>lore from older editions</li>
				<li>races from older editions</li>
				<li>classes from older editions</li>
				<li>alternativee backgrounds</li>
			</ul>

Perspectives on RAW/RAI/RAF:
D&D 5e: Official Sourcebooks & Errata => Sage Advice => Jimmy Crawford => Mike Mearls => DM
Reality: DM => Official Sourcebooks & Errata => Sage Advice => Jimmy Crawford => Mike Mearls
Many players prefer RAF - they are intended as guide lines - strict RAW/RAI risk becoming generic and mechanic, while the game is intended to be a fun experience.
